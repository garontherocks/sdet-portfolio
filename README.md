This public SDET portfolio demonstrates best practices using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with JavaScript, and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with TypeScript. Tests target the demo website [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) and cover UI and API automation workflows. The project evolves iteratively to include performance, stress, visual testing, reporting, and CI/CD.

## Whatâ€™s Covered

- Full coverage for login, cart, and API flows (Cypress & Playwright)
- Page Object Model architecture
- Centralized, reusable test data
- CI pipelines for Cypress, Playwright, and ESLint
- Pre-commit validation using Husky + lint-staged

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garontherocks/sdet-portfolio.git
cd sdet-portfolio
npm install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm run open --workspace=cypress        # Cypress UI mode
npm run run --workspace=cypress         # Cypress headless
npm run test --workspace=playwright     # Playwright headless
```

## ðŸ“‹ Reporting

### Cypress + Mochawesome
![Cypress report](https://img.shields.io/badge/report-mochawesome-blue)

- `npm run run --workspace=cypress`  
- `npm run report:merge --workspace=cypress`  
- `npm run report:gen   --workspace=cypress`  
- Open `cypress/reports/mochawesome/html/index.html`

### Playwright + Allure
![Allure report](https://img.shields.io/badge/report-allure-red)

- `npm run test --workspace=playwright`  
- `npm run allure:generate --workspace=playwright`  
- `npm run allure:open     --workspace=playwright`  

### Lighthouse CI (Performance Testing)
![Lighthouse](https://img.shields.io/badge/report-lighthouse-yellow)

- `npm run lhci`  
- Lighthouse analyzes the public site [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com)  
- Reports are uploaded to temporary Google Cloud links (printed in terminal)  
- Configuration via `lighthouserc.js`

## Visual Testing (Percy)

- Percy integration enabled for Cypress and Playwright test cases.
- Visual snapshots are taken using percySnapshot().
- Requires valid PERCY_TOKEN in CI (configured in GitHub Secrets).
- Run visual tests locally (Cypress):

```bash
npx percy exec -- npx cypress run
```

- Run visual tests locally (Playwright):

```bash
npm run percy:playwright --workspace=playwright
```

- Percy build results are available at [percy.io](https://percy.io)

## ðŸš€ Performance Testing (k6)

k6 integration enabled for load and smoke testing.

Performance test scripts are stored under `playwright/performance`.

Run manually:

```bash
k6 run performance/smoke.test.js
```

Executed automatically via GitHub Actions on push/PR.

## Code Quality & Linting

- ESLint checks run locally and in CI (GitHub Actions).
- Pre-commit hooks automatically fix staged issues with lint-staged.

Run manually:

```bash
npm run lint                            # Analyze all .js and .ts files
npm run lint:fix                        # Auto-fix fixable issues
```

## Practices & Structure

- Feature-based folder organization (login, cart, etc.)
- Clean Page Object Model abstraction
- DRY test logic via reusable data and utilities
- Clear test naming and assertions
