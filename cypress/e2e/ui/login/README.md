# Login UI Tests

This folder contains automated login tests for SauceDemo:

- Successful login with a valid user
- Failed login with a locked out user

The Page Object Model (POM) pattern is used to encapsulate interactions with the login page, and user information comes from `cypress/test-data/users.js`.
