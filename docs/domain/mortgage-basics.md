Mortgage Basics (Quick Glossary)

- Underwriting: credit risk evaluation of the borrower and the property. Verifies income, liabilities, credit history, and collateral against lending guidelines.
- Loan Origination: end‑to‑end process of creating a new loan (application, documentation, underwriting, approval, closing, funding). Systems often called LOS.
- Appraisal: independent valuation of the property to confirm collateral value meets or exceeds loan amount.
- DTI (Debt‑to‑Income): ratio of monthly debt payments to monthly gross income; a key underwriting metric.
- LTV (Loan‑to‑Value): loan amount divided by appraised value; affects interest rate and mortgage insurance.
- Closing Disclosure (CD): final statement of loan terms, closing costs, and cash to close; must be delivered before closing.

Testing Angles
- Data validation: consistent borrower/profile data across services (LOS, underwriting, docs).
- Rules engines: verify underwriting decisions against policy matrices and edge cases.
- Documents: PDFs generated with correct fees, APR, and signatures; compare via snapshot/PDF text.
- Integrations: credit bureaus, appraisal providers, e‑signing services; stub in lower envs.
