# Cart UI Tests

This folder contains automated shopping cart tests for SauceDemo:

- Adding products (single and multiple)
- Removing products
- Validating item count and calculating subtotal
- Complete purchase flow with confirmation

All tests use the `CartPage.ts` object to encapsulate UI logic, and reusable test data from `test-data/users.ts`.
