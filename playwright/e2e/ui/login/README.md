# Login UI Tests

This directory contains automated login tests for the SauceDemo website using Playwright:

- Successful login with valid credentials
- Failed login with a locked out user

These tests use the Page Object Model to encapsulate login page interactions, and load user credentials from `test-data/users.ts`.
